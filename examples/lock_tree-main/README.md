# lock_tree

A standalone republication of the [netstack3](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/roadmap/2021/netstack3) lock-ordering crate, part of Google's [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/) OS. This crate was named lock_tree due to a crates.io conflict.

lock_tree empowers you to prevent deadlocks at compile time, providing traits that enforce lock
ordering statically.
